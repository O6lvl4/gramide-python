"""What the Python package reports as definitions and references, and what it does not.

`tags` is the repo map's input: definitions to rank, references to rank them by.
Python has no node that means "a type", so a type mention is read from the three
places one can be written — after a `:`, after a `->`, and in a class's bases —
and only when what is written there is a bare name. Everything this does not
cover is listed at the bottom of this file, as a case with no output, so that
adding it later is a diff here rather than a surprise.
